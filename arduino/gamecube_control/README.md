This Arduino code acts as a Gamecube controller

This code works with the Arduino Uno, and probably the Duemilanove too. The
Leonardo has different pin mappings, so it won't work out of the box. You'll
either have to change the assembly code to use the correct pin, or move the
data wire to a different pin (let me know if you try this).
